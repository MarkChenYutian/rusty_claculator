# Rusty *Clac*ulator

An implementation of the `Clac` language in 15-122 programming homework with Rust.

## How to Run

Open the terminal in root directory of this repo, then run with

```shell
$ cargo run
```

## The Clac Language

*Clac* is a stack-based language. All operators are in a queue, and operands are in a stack. Everytime, an operator will obtain operand from the stack and push the result back to stack.

*Clac* uses a postfix expression to calculate, that is, you need to write `1 1 +` instead of `1 + 1`.

There are a series of native operators defined in Clac, shown as follow:

**What makes Clac powerful is the abilty to define Symbols (Macros).** You can define a specific symbol as a queue of operands. Everytime the interpretor meets a new symbol, it will replace it with the pre-defined queue of operands.

What's more, you can define new symbols upon previously defined symbols. This provides very useful abstraction tool.

The syntax for defining symbol is

```
: Symbol op1 op2 op3 ;
```

For example, below lines define two Symbols - `dup` and `square`

```
// Note: Rusty clac does NOT support comment, these are only for demonstration
: dup 1 pick ;    // S: x => S: x, x
: square dup * ;  // S: x => S: x**2
```

## TODO

* üõ†Ô∏è Improve Symbol define function such to enable nested definition of symbol. For instance, the following sequence should be valid.
  ```
  : redef_f : f 2 + ; ;
  ```
